                Colonial Club is the fifth oldest club on Prospect Avenue and is easily recognizable by its four large, white columns fashioned in the Colonial Revival style.  As the first of Princetonâ€™s eating clubs to move away from the bicker process and to go coeducational in 1969, we have retained an openness that has encompassed the heart of our community ever since.
