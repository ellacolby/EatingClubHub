                    In 1884, a group of freshman, members of the Class of 1888 chose to eat in a private room on the second floor of Dohm’s Restaurant on Nassau Street across from the campus. In time, this group named themselves “The Seven Wise Men of Grease,” a reflection of the meals they endured.
