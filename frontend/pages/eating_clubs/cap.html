                A club that is “wildly enthusiastic on weekends and rarely tweedy,” Cannon Dial Elm Club dons the names of four eating clubs: Cannon Club, Dial Lodge,  Elm Club, and DEC. Reopened in 2011 and tracing its roots back to 1896, the club has quickly cemented itself on the Street once more.
